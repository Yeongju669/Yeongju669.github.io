    <h3>Afterwards</h3>
      <h4>BY T.J. CLARK</h4>
      <p>The sea in the wind in the half-light, clearing its throat of  pebbles,<br>
      Cloud shadows coming down the mountain with the steady speed<br>
      Of a paddle wheel. Light on the foothills already gone,<br>
      So that you need not look at the seminary on top<br>
      Of  the tallest—fat, square, and gray as a helping of lard.<br>
      <br>      <br>
      The roar from the beach stops suddenly, as if waves lost their nerve.<br>
      One dead branch of olive higher than Tsiknias from where I sit,<br>
      Its fingers pressed against the aquarium of the sky.<br>
      Then the sudden humanity of a bell<br>
      Struck twice, twice more, the rope<br>
      Rattling in its socket.<br>
      <br>      <br>   
      Earlier on I had colored the mountainside, crudely but fairly,<br>
      Getting at least the fall of the scree right<br>
      And the rasp of sun across schist—well, almost.<br>
      I look down at the painting now and try to decide<br>
      If the scene looks ready for the bell to sound.<br>
      <br>      <br>
      No scene ever is.
      Danger and chance are written on the face of things,<br>
      Grass fires, fog, fault lines, winds from the north,<br>
      Clumps of arthritic pines protesting,<br>
      Havoc among the flowering onions,<br>
      Ghosts, and the world descending<br>
      To waterlessness and unwelcome summer—<br>
      But not recurrence, not Nature, not the order of  service.<br>
      <br>      <br>
      A snarling of  pebbles up from the beach again, as if  the waves<br>
      Have decided they might still win. Then the bell from the village.<br>
      The rope’s dry cough.</p>
